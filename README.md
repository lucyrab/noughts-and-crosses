Noughts and Crosses
===================
This is a simple game of noughts and crosses (or tic tac toe as it is known in the US) that I made in flask to practice my flask programming. It allows the user to select between playing a two player game where both players play on the same device and playing a game against the computer. Currently, in the second version, the computer selects its location to play randomly out of the available options, but in the future I hope to improve this, maybe using this program as a base for learning some machine learning techniques.
